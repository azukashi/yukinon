## :rocket: Deployments

There is currently 2 deployments here. Production and Preview deployments. Stable changes are served in production deployment and current changes are served in preview deployment. I will mostly commit to [`next`](https://github.com/gifaldyazkaa/yukinon/tree/next) branch. Any current changes will be deployed to Preview.

> **Note**
> Preview deployments are unstable, but there is a lot changes from production. If you like spoilers, instead of waiting the Production updated, visit the preview one.

## :card_index_divider: Back-end stack

I am using [Strapi](https://strapi.io) as the Back-end of this web app and as Content Management System (CMS). Almost every text, content, and data you have seen inside the website is stored in MySQL and Strapi as the interface. Localized content too. It's possible to store it inside Strapi belongside the original data without any hard step required. Big thanks to Strapi for this feature.

The code base for Strapi are separated. You can visit the code base for the back-end on [gifaldyazkaa/yukinon-strapi](https://github.com/yukinon-strapi).
